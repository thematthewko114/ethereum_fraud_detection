# Ethereum Fraud Detection with Pytorch
 
## Background info

Hello world!

### Introduction

This is my final-year project as a Computer Engineering student in CUHK, supervised by [Prof. Zili Shao](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~shao/) from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/).

### Project Objective

To develop efficient and effective Ethereum fraud dection techniques by utilizing AI technology (e.g. Graph Attention Network).

## Installation

1. I will use the conda environment manager to run the project script using Jupyter Notebook, install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/) first
2. You may use the Navigator or the anaconda prompt to launch Jupyter Notebook (including creating a new environment), I will create a new environment for the project. To run it with the anaconda prompt, run these commands
```
conda create -n <YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME>
conda activate <YOUR-ENVIRONMENT-NAME>
conda install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```
3. Your browser should be running the notebook if there are no errors!
4. Run the project by finding the index.ipynb and run the script.

### Misc
- Any advice or suggestions are welcome! If you find any problems, please contact me by email via iammatthewko114@gmail.com.
